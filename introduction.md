# Introduction
Arsenic contamination of groundwater has created a public health crisis in Bangladesh. It affects millions of people who rely on the contaminated water for drinking and domestic purposes.
The extent of this contamination varies widely across the country, with some areas having dangerously high levels (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2005.08.034).
Because of the number of people who rely on groundwater and the health risks associated with arsenic exposure, there is a high demand for methods to spatially predict the probability that arsenic concentrations will exceed a safety threshold.
Geostatistical indicator techniques provide a powerful approach to this challenge, allowing the assessment and mapping of the risk of arsenic contamination above critical levels such as 10 µg/l and 50 µg/l. Specifically, Indicator Simulation can be used to generate probabilistic maps of these higher probabilities. This provides valuable information for risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
